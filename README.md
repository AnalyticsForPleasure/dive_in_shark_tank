# dive_in_shark_tank

Today we will work on the dataset taken from the kaggle website.
The dataset that we will dive into today would be on the “Shark Tank” TV show.
For some of you, who aren’t similar with the TV show “Shark Tank” series, the show is a show where entrepreneurs present their product or service to a panel of lenders or “sharks” for money. Then, they do a presentation in front of the panel of sharks. After the presentation, the entrepreneurs will seek money in return for a percentage of their company.
